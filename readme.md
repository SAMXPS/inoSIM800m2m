# Simple SIM800 M2M TCP library

This is a simple SIM800 library for arduino that uses the AT commands to configure the SIM800 module and
connect it to a single TCP server. It was built and tested using the SIM800L module and an Arduino Uno.

This library is based on the M2M idea, that is, machine to machine connection. So, this (work in progress) library
is intended to be used in IOT applications using arduino or similar ARM based systems.

# TODO: 
- Implement multiple-connection mode
- Handle incoming SMS/Calls
- Documentation
